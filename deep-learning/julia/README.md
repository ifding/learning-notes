# Deap Learning with Julia


Julia: Looks like Python, feels like Lisp, runs like Fortran


### Why julia?

As ML models began to need the full power of a programming language,getting Python to scale to ML’s heavy computational demands is far harder than you might expect. Python’s semantics also make it fundamentally difficult to provide model-level parallelism or compile models for small devices.
